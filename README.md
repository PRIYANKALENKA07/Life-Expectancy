💡 Life Expectancy Analysis

📌 Description  
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of **global life expectancy trends** and the factors influencing them.  
The dataset includes details on GDP per capita, government health expenditure, immunization rates, child/maternal mortality, and access to safe drinking water across countries and continents.

After cleaning and preparing the data, I used **Power BI** to build interactive dashboards that highlight health and socioeconomic KPIs.  

Key takeaways include:  
- Countries with **>85% safe drinking water coverage** show the largest gains in life expectancy  
- **Women live longer than men** globally (avg. +5 years)  
- **GDP per capita** strongly correlates with life expectancy but varies by region  
- **Africa** had the longest GDP growth (1960–2001) but still faces the widest life expectancy gap  
- **San Marino** had the highest GDP per capita ($59,009.56) while **Japan** had the highest life expectancy (85 years)

📊 Overview  
The interactive **Life Expectancy Dashboard** is designed for:  
- Public health policymakers  
- Development agencies (WHO, World Bank, UN)  
- Data scientists & analysts studying socio-economic indicators  

With this dashboard, users can:  
- Track life expectancy by country, gender, and continent  
- Compare GDP vs life expectancy across regions  
- Identify drivers like water access, immunization, and healthcare spending  
- Analyze YoY changes (1800–2017)  
- Explore country-wise performance and root causes

📌 5 Actionable Insights for Stakeholders  

1. **Safe water coverage (>85%) increases life expectancy** → Prioritize infrastructure in developing regions  
2. **Women outlive men globally by 5+ years** → Healthcare systems should tailor gender-specific interventions  
3. **Africa’s GDP growth didn’t fully improve life expectancy** → Non-economic factors (health access, conflicts) play major roles  
4. **Japan leads life expectancy (85 years)** → Adopt lessons from high-performing healthcare systems  
5. **Immunization & health expenditure** are strong drivers → Investing in preventive care yields long-term benefits
